(Image in: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/glaucoma-detection)

## 1. Introduction
Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that has been a leading cause of irreversible vision loss in clinics for over a decade. Early diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma are crucial to prevent further visual impairment. By establishing an easy-to-use auxiliary diagnostic platform with high accuracy and efficiency, our software aims to help medical professionals predict the risk of developing glaucoma by analyzing patients' retinal scan images. The operating guide, software design flow, model training process, and future application prospects for software developers, testers, biomedical researchers, and end-users are elaborated in this document.

## 2. Instructions for Use
### 2.1 Environment Setup

* **Python Version:**  Python >= 3.10 is required.

* **Dependencies:**  Install dependencies from `requirements.txt` using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

* **Unzip models:**  Decompress the files "model_weights_V3.zip" into the "models\weights" folder.

### 2.2 Interactive Interface

* **Image Upload**: Users can upload retinal scan images via a simple table.
* **Prediction Type Selection**: Users can choose the prediction type based on the input image. If the uploaded image is a raw, unprocessed retinal scan, select the 'Raw Image' type. If the uploaded image is a segmented retinal scan, select the 'Segmented Image' type.
* **Prediction Conducting**: The software will display the original image, the segmented image (if applicable), and the prediction results from various models.

### 2.3 Results Interpretation

#### 2.3.1 Raw Image Type

* **Image Preprocessing:** The system receives the uploaded raw retinal images and performs necessary preprocessing steps, such as resizing and contrast enhancement, to standardize the images.

* **Optic Disc and Vessel Segmentation:** A neural network is used to segment the optic disc, optic cup, and blood vessels. The results are displayed in the "Segmented Disc and Cup" and "Segmented Blood Vessels" sections.

* **Classification according to Two Features:** A trained model (e.g., ResNet 18, ResNet 50, Xception, VGG16) is used to predict the health status of the optic disc and blood vessels. The prediction results from each model are displayed individually.

* **Result Display:** Based on the predictions from various models, three models predict "Negative," while one model predicts "Positive." The final result is "Little Probability of Glaucoma."

#### 2.3.2 Segmented Image Type

* **Image Preprocessing:** The system receives the uploaded pre-cropped retinal images and performs necessary preprocessing steps, such as resizing and contrast enhancement, to standardize the images.

* **Direct Classification according to Segmented Images**: A trained model (e.g., ResNet 18, ResNet 50, Xception, VGG16) is used to predict the positive and negative status for glaucoma. The prediction results from each model are displayed individually.

* **Result Display**: Based on the predictions from various models, all four models predict "Negative," and the final result is "Healthy."

#### 2.3.3 Final Prediction Principle

- **Epochs**: Train for 10-25 epochs depending on when the model converges.
- **Hardware**: Preferably use GPU for faster training.

#### 3.2.5 Model Evaluation & Saving
- **Evaluation**: After each training epoch, evaluate the model on the validation set to track performance.
- **Saving**: Save the model weights whenever validation accuracy improves.

## 4. Application Prospects
This software serves as an auxiliary diagnostic tool, enabling doctors to identify glaucoma in its early stages. It enhances the accuracy of diagnostic processes and minimizes the risk of incorrect diagnoses. By enabling earlier treatment interventions, the software significantly contributes to improved patient prognoses. Additionally, it assists patients with retinal examinations to monitor disease progression.

Subsequent software development could focus on the following aspects:
1. Integrating more data types, such as optical coherence tomography, and physiological indicators like retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, to achieve higher prediction accuracy.
2. Adding a function to provide appropriate treatment plans based on the patient's disease stage.
3. Expanding the application range by developing prediction models for other eye diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy.
